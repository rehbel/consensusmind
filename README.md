cd C:\consensusmind
del README.md
```

Then create a new file using a text editor, OR:

**Alternative approach - Create README.md manually:**

1. Open Notepad
2. Copy the content I'll provide below
3. Save as `README.md` in `C:\consensusmind`
4. Make sure "Save as type" is "All Files" and encoding is "UTF-8"

**Content for README.md:**

# ConsensusMind

Autonomous AI researcher for blockchain consensus mechanisms.

## Overview

ConsensusMind is an autonomous research agent that conducts end-to-end research on blockchain consensus protocols. It performs literature review, generates hypotheses, runs simulations, and writes academic papers.

## Status

**Current Version:** 0.1.0 - Milestone 1 Complete

### Completed Milestones

#### Milestone 1: Foundation & Infrastructure
- Project initialization and structure
- Configuration system with TOML and environment variable support
- Logging infrastructure (file + console)
- LLM client with exponential backoff retry logic
- Integration tests
- Production-ready code quality (zero warnings)

## Features

### Current (v0.1.0)
- Configuration management from TOML files
- Environment variable overrides for sensitive data
- Structured logging to file and console
- HTTP client for vLLM/RunPod inference endpoints
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive error handling

### Planned
- Automated literature analysis from arXiv and academic databases
- Semantic search over consensus research papers
- Hypothesis generation for novel consensus mechanisms
- Protocol simulation and benchmarking
- Automated LaTeX paper generation

## Architecture

Built in Rust for production reliability and performance.

**Core Components:**
- Agent executor with planning and memory
- Knowledge base with vector search
- Consensus protocol simulator
- LLM client for reasoning tasks
- LaTeX/Markdown output generation

**Tech Stack:**
- Language: Rust 2021 edition
- Async Runtime: Tokio
- HTTP Client: Reqwest with rustls
- Logging: Tracing
- Config: TOML
- LLM: Self-hosted vLLM (DeepSeek/Qwen)

## Requirements

- Rust 1.70+
- GPU inference server (RunPod, self-hosted vLLM, or compatible endpoint)
- Storage for paper corpus

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/ChronoCoders/consensusmind.git
cd consensusmind
cargo build --release

## Configuration

Create config.toml in the project root with LLM endpoint, API key, model settings, paths, agent parameters, and logging configuration.

Environment variable overrides available:
- LLM_ENDPOINT
- LLM_API_KEY
- LLM_MODEL
- CONFIG_PATH

## Usage

Run: consensusmind

Currently initializes the system and validates configuration.

## Development

Build: cargo build
Test: cargo test
Format: cargo fmt
Lint: cargo clippy
Release: cargo build --release
